## 1. 📦 Containerized environment

Remember that the environment is a containerized environment, you can verify this with the username, the username in the Host is `ubuntu` and the username in the container is `vscode`.

### Host user
The user on the host is `ubuntu`
```bash
❯ whoami
ubuntu
```

### 1.1. Check that the environment is running
```bash
❯ docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                          COMMAND                  CREATED      STATUS      PORTS                                                                                                  NAMES
4fadf6961dae   kindest/node:v1.30.0           "/usr/local/bin/entr…"   2 days ago   Up 2 days   0.0.0.0:6443->6443/tcp, 0.0.0.0:30100->30100/tcp, 0.0.0.0:30200->30200/tcp, 0.0.0.0:30300->30300/tcp   kind-control-plane
7ec72707a58c   shinojosa/dt-enablement:v1.2   "/entrypoint.sh /usr…"   2 days ago   Up 2 days 
```

You'll notice that the user is ubuntu (default user) and that containers are running, the dt-enablement image and [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/). The strategy used is docker-in-socket strategy, you can learn more about that [here](https://dynatrace-wwse.github.io/codespaces-framework/container-image/#docker-in-socket-strategy).

This allows us to have our dev environment in docker and the kubernetes also containerized but separate, for advanced use-cases you can delete the containers independently and attach them back as needed, meaning you can nuke the kubernetes cluster and create a new one without affecting the other container. 


!!! test "DevOps Mantra"
    Having a containerized environment allows you to play-around and test in a safe way, meaning feel free to install stuff, break it, and build it again which is somewhat the devops mantra ***"Build fast, fail fast, break fast & learn fast"***


### 1.2. 💻 Shell into the environment

```bash
cd .devcontainer && make start
```

??? tip "Shell into the environment"
    ![alt text](img/greeting.png)

When you shell into the environment, the `make start` command will check if a container with the name `dt-enablement` is running, if so, it'll connect to it, if not, then it'll create a new environment. Once inside the container the Dynatrace greeting will appear with information about the environment.

### 1.3. 💻 Create new Terminal 

For creating a new terminal in the container, just create a new Terminal in VS Code and then shell into the environment as explained before `cd .devcontainer && make start`


??? tip " 💻 Protip: Automatic shell inside the container"
    So you don't have to type every time you create a new terminal `cd .devcontainer && make start`, in VS Code you can add a setting for the Terminal so that it does this every time you launch the terminal. 
    
    This repository has the setting added for you, it can be found under `.vscode/settings.json`

    ```{ title=".vscode/settings.json" linenums="1" .json .copy }
    {
    "terminal.integrated.profiles.linux": {
        "Shell in container": {
        "path": "bash",
        "args": [
            "-c",
            "cd .devcontainer && make start; exec bash"
        ]
        }
      }
    //, "terminal.integrated.defaultProfile.linux": "Shell in container"
    }
    ```
    On the terminal tab, click on the `v` icon, and select the profile "Shell in container", this will either shell in the active running container, start it if it has been stopped or create a new one if it does not exist. 

    If you remove the comment on line 11, it will make it the default profile (only for this VS Code workplace) so you shell into the container on every "New Terminal"

### 1.4. Container user
To make sure you are inside the container you can also type:
```bash
❯ whoami
vscode
```
The user is not ubuntu anymore, but vscode which is the default user for the container.

### 1.5. Show the greeting, reload the functions
The default terminal is `zsh` with powerlevel10k enabled for a better dev experience. If you want to show the greeting just type `printGreeting` or `zsh`. Difference is with a new shell (`zsh`) the functions are loaded again (good to know if you are developing the framework, you can add your custom functions in `my_functions.sh`). 
```bash
zsh
```

### 1.6. 💥 Nuke the environment
Let's say you want to start fresh, delete the `dt-enablement`container and nuke `kind` this is very simple, just kill and delete the containers and start again.
This will kill and delete the containers
```bash
docker kill kind-control-plane && docker rm  kind-control-plane 
docker kill dt-enablemenent && docker rm dt-enablemenent
```

### 1.7. 🔄 Restart the environment
For restarting the environment just be sure there are no containers running or stopped, otherwise it'll start them. Then type `make start` inside the `.devcontainer` folder
```bash
cd .devcontainer
make start
```


## 2. 🎡 Kubernetes
The enablement environment contains a Kubernetes cluster.  

### 2.1. Functions to manage the Kubernetes Cluster

 - `startKindCluster`: will start the cluster (or creates a new one if no stopped container is available) 
 
 - `stopKindCluster`: stops the cluster 
 
 - `createKindCluster`: creates a new cluster 
 
 - `deleteKindCluster`: deletes the cluster

 - `attachKindCluster`: attaches to a running cluster (generates the kubeconfig with the new certificates). This function can be also used from the Host like `source .devcontainer/util/source_framework.sh && attachKindCluster`. You need `kubectl` and `kind` installed on the Host.


### 2.2. Navigate in Kubernetes with k9s 

***Kubernetes CLI To Manage Your Clusters In Style!*** [K9s](https://k9scli.io/) is a terminal-based UI to interact with your Kubernetes clusters and is installed in the environment. 

![k9s](img/k9s.png)

It is very easy to navigate in Kubernetes clusters with the keyboard, shell into a running container, forward a port, scale a deployment, describe a pod, and more.  

Just type in the terminal `k9s` to open k9s. 
```bash
k9s
```

### 2.2.1. k9s Keybindings

| `?` | Show help/keybindings |

## 3. Apps 

The enablement brings a repository of applications that can be deployed easily in the Kubernetes cluster. Running `deployApp` without parameters displays an interactive help menu listing all available apps, their aliases, and their compatibility (AMD/ARM). Example output

### 3.1. Deploy an app
Use any of the listed numbers, characters, or names. For example, to deploy astroshop, you can run:

```bash
deployApp 2
# or
deployApp b
# or
deployApp astroshop
```
### 3.2. Undeploy an app

Add `-d` (for delete) as an extra argument:

```bash
deployApp 2 -d
# or
deployApp astroshop -d 
```

![apps](img/deployapp.png)

### 4. 🧹 Reclaim Disk Space

If you've been deploying and undeploying apps for a while, you may notice Kubernetes reporting **DiskPressure** on the node. Symptoms include:

- Pods stuck in `Pending` or `Evicted` state
- Node conditions showing `DiskPressure: True` (visible in `k9s` under `:node` → `d` to describe)
- Warnings like *"The node was low on resource: ephemeral-storage"*

This happens because package manager caches, old container images, build artifacts, temp files, and journal logs accumulate over time.

#### Run the cleanup function

You can **safely run this while the environment is running** — it does not affect running containers, pods, or your Kubernetes cluster:

```bash
freeUpSpace
```

The function will print disk usage **before** and **after** so you can see how much space was recovered.

#### What does it do?

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **APT cleanup** | Removes unused packages (`autoremove`) and clears the package cache (`autoclean`, `clean`) |
| **Journal logs** | Trims systemd journal logs to the last 7 days or 200 MB max |
| **pip cache** | Purges the Python pip/pip3 download cache |
| **npm / yarn / pnpm** | Cleans Node.js package manager caches |
| **Docker prune** | Removes **unused** images, stopped containers, dangling volumes, and build cache — running containers are not touched |
| **Temp files** | Deletes files in `/tmp` older than 7 days |
| **User cache** | Removes stale directories under `~/.cache` older than 30 days |

!!! tip "Docker prune is usually the biggest win"
    After deploying and undeploying several apps, old container images pile up. The Docker prune step typically frees the most space. It only removes images and volumes **not in use** by any running container, so your active environment stays intact.

!!! note "Re-pulling images after cleanup"
    Since unused Docker images are removed, the next time you deploy an app that was previously cached, it will need to pull the image again. This is expected and only adds a small delay on the first deploy.
