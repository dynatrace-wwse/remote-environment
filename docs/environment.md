# Prerequisites: Quick Step by Step Guide

!!! tip "Prerequisites"
    - Provision Infrastructure
    - Download Visual Studio Code

## Prerequisites
### 1.- Provision Infrastructure 

For the remote environment we'll use an EC2 Instance in the AWS cloud.

Navigate to your AWS Account and open create EC2 instance:

- Give it a name like `Sergio Hinojosa's Environment`
- Select Ubuntu as OS
- Amazon Machine Image (AMI)
    - Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS (HVM), SSD Volume - Architecture 64-bit (x86)
- Instance Type
    - t3.xlarge (4vCPU 16 GiB Memory)
- Key pair
    - If you don't have one, create it
    - Enter key pair name
    - Type: RSA
    - Format: pem
    - Create the Identity file and download it to your computer (A good place could be something like `/Users/firstname.lastname/.aws/keys/onboarding.pem` )
- Disk
    - Allocate 40 Gig of Disk space, this should be more than enough for your onboarding journey
- Network policies Incoming 22, 80 
    - Optional: Ports 8000, 30100, 30200, 30300 if you want to deploy more apps and want to access them via the default exposure
- Launch instance

??? info "App exposure on http 80"
    The apps in this framework are exposed via Kubernetes NodePort in the ports 30100, 30200 and 30300. For convenience reasons, in this training port 30100 will be routed via IPTABLES to port 80 with the function `exposeOnHttp`. Reason is that some corporate firewalls block traffic in those ports.

Performance and CPU Credits:

T2 Instances: Use a fixed CPU credit system. They accumulate CPU credits when idle and spend them when they are active. They have limited baseline CPU performance.
T3 Instances: Are more efficient with a burstable CPU model and are not only capable of sustaining burst performance but can also use unlimited mode, which allows them to exceed their CPU credits whe

In summary, T3 instances provide better overall performance, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness compared to T2 instances. For new applications and workloads, T3 is generally recommended over T2.

### 2.- Download Visual Studio Code

- Go to  [https://code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com), download and install Visual Studio Code on your machine. 

!!! tip "Tip"
    Working on a local Visual Studio Code maximizes your productivity. You'll be able to connect to dev containers remotely or locally, install plugins, and much more.

#### 2.1 - Install VS Code Remote Explorer Extension

- You'll need the Remote Explorer extension `ms-vscode.remote-explorer` so you can connect to your server via SSH and develop from the IDE as if you were working on your localhost.
